# ScienceFiction_Library

Content library that implements the principles of **OOP**.\
The specification for this projects are described in the LateX file but here there is a summary of the most significant ones:
- Information Hiding
- Clear separation between *Logical Model* and *GUI*
- Non trivial *Polymorphism* implementation (NO Getters or GetType)
- Classes Hierarchy
- Data Persistency (*XML, JSON*)
## GUI
The GUI is created with the **Qt** library.
It's a simple, very essential Graphic Interaface that focus on **Usability** rather then eye-catching impact and for this reason could be improved.
It offers:
- Filtering options 
- Diversified view for different kind of Content
- Intuitive Buttons
- Easy to read icons
